***PRESENTING STREETSENSE, A REAL-TIME TRAFFIC FLOW CONTROL SYSTEM ðŸš˜ðŸš¨***


The Intelligent Traffic Control System is an innovative project that leverages computer vision techniques to enhance traffic management. This system utilizes surveillance camera footage to detect and track vehicles in real time, providing valuable information for efficient traffic control. The project involves various stages, including object detection, object tracking, and broadcasting alerts contributing to a comprehensive solution for monitoring and managing traffic flow.

Key Components:

1. Car Detection using YOLO:
   - Integration of a pre-trained YOLO (You Only Look Once) model for accurate car detection in video frames.
   - Utilization of YOLO's ability to detect multiple objects simultaneously with bounding box coordinates.

2. Object Tracking 
   - Implementation of object tracking algorithms, such as optical flow or Kalman filtering, to follow the detected cars across consecutive frames.
   - Enhancing the stability and robustness of tracking algorithms to handle occlusions and varying traffic conditions.

3. Real-time Visualization:
   - Display of video frames with bounding boxes around detected cars and additional information, such as vehicle labels and speed.
   - Real-time monitoring of traffic conditions for better decision-making.
     
4. Integration with Traffic Control System:
   - Connection of the traffic control system with the broader traffic management infrastructure.
   - Triggering signals, alerts, or other control actions based on detected events and speed information.

5. Optimization and Adaptability:
   - Fine-tuning of parameters to optimize the system's accuracy and performance.
   - Adaptation to changing environmental conditions, such as varying light and weather, to ensure reliable operation.
